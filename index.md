## Two Wheel Robot

Project Goals:
  1. Create a complete, ideal model of an unstable two wheel robot with Lagrangian dynamics
  2. Use the mathematical model to generate possible robot trajectories from a given starting location to ending location (feed forward control)
  3. Use the mathematical model to design a time-variant Linear Quatratic Regulator to stabalize and execute the trajectory

### Physical Model with Lagrangian Dynamics

Lagrangian dynamics reduces the task of computing a mathematical model of a mechanical system to a straightforward applicatoin of differential equations and energetics. While Newtonian dynamics requires keeping track of explicit constraint forces and requires the use of a cartesian coordinate system, Lagrangian dynamics is very effective at simplifying complex systems by enforcing constraings implicitly, which greatly reduces the the number of equations and variables required to model a system.
